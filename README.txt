I have made this project at the beginning of my web and mobile web developer training.

It was made around November 2022, I decided to share it on Github even if it isn't finished to give a vision on my work and progression.

After a little of algrithm practice on Algobox, the first exercice was to made a responsive static web site for the training organization.

I chose to use the media queries for the responsive, because I wanted to practice as I had never used them before. I could have used any library or flexbox or grid.

Many things could be improved, but it was my first project and I had to go through other technologies so I stopped working on it.
